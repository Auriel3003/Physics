# ER Diagram

> An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships to each other. 
> 
> It is used to model a database schema and to visualize the relationships between entities in a clear and concise way.

  * Identify the entities: An entity is an object or concept that has a set of attributes that describe it.
  * Define the attributes: For each entity, define the attributes that describe it.
  * Define the relationships: Identify the relationships between the entities.
  * Draw the diagram: Use symbols and notation to represent the entities, attributes, and relationships in the ER diagram. The most common symbols used in ER diagrams are rectangles for entities, diamonds for relationships, and ovals for attributes.
  * Add cardinality and participation: Cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that can be related to the instances of another entity. Participation defines whether an instance of one entity must be related to an instance of another entity or not.
