# REACHING TO THE SUN
### Guest lecture by Dr. Helen Mason 

Antariksh, the astronomy club of Vishwakarma Institutes, organized an event on February 24th, 2023, titled "Reaching to the Sun." The guest lecture featured Dr. Helen Mason, a renowned solar scientist at the University of Cambridge, who has worked with NASA, ESA, ISRO, and Japanese space agencies. Dr. Mason's international reputation in the field of solar physics, with particular expertise in the analysis of ultraviolet and X-ray spectra from the solar atmosphere, made her an ideal speaker for the event. She is currently the head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge.

The event aimed to provide space enthusiasts with an opportunity to explore astronomy through a lecture. Dr. Mason's lecture covered various topics related to the sun, including the dynamic sun, sunspots, solar active regions, flares, the solar wind, and how the sun affects the Earth's environment. The event was open to participants from different engineering and pure science colleges in Pune, who gathered to interact with the distinguished speaker.

Dr. Mason was accompanied by Dr. Megha Anand, who is currently pursuing her post-doctoral degree at IUCAA, and Mr. Jameer Manur, the club mentor, and a bridge between IUCAA and VIT. The event was attended by dignitaries from VIT, including Dr. Shripad Bhatlawande, Prof. Shital Raut, and over 40 faculties. The event was managed by ten volunteers from the Antariksh club and two members from VClick.

After an hour of an amazing presentation by Dr. Mason, the event concluded with an engaging question and answer session where many students had the privilege to interact with her. The event was a huge success, thanks to the efforts of the organizers and the participation of the attendees. We look forward to more such informative and inspiring events in the future.

Here are some glimpse of session.
